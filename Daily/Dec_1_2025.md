# TIL: What I Learned from CSE 6730 (Modeling and Simulation)

This semester, I took **CSE 6730: Modeling and Simulation** at Georgia Tech. It was a rigorous dive into how we can use computational methods to understand complex real-world systems. Here is a retrospective on the key concepts I mastered and the project I delivered.

## 1. The Power of Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)
I learned that complex global behaviors—like political polarization or cultural consensus—often emerge from simple local interactions.
* **The Concept:** Instead of using top-down equations, ABM simulates individual agents (people) making decisions based on their neighbors.
* **My Application:** For our final project, we built a **Hybrid Cultural Dissemination Model**. We combined the **Axelrod Model** (discrete traits) with the **Deffuant Model** (continuous bounded confidence) to simulate how extremist views spread in social networks.

## 2. Bridging Theory and Code (OOP Implementation)
One of the biggest challenges was translating abstract mathematical concepts into robust Python code.
* **Data Structures matter:** I was responsible for constructing the underlying data structures. I learned to use `NetworkX` to generate **Multilayer Small-World Networks**, representing how people exist in different social contexts (e.g., family vs. work) simultaneously.
* **Object-Oriented Design:** We built a custom `SimulationRunner` class. This modular approach allowed us to switch between different interaction modes ("average" vs. "copy") without rewriting the core engine.

## 3. The Importance of Topology
We discovered that *who* you are connected to matters just as much as *what* you believe.
* **Small-World Networks:** I learned about the Watts-Strogatz model. A high rewiring probability ($p$) creates "shortcuts" that speed up consensus, while low rewiring creates local "echo chambers" where polarization thrives.
* **Extremism vs. Structure:** Our experiments showed a counter-intuitive result: widespread extremism doesn't just divide society into two neat camps; it destroys the community structure entirely, leading to "diffuse radicalization."

## 4. Verification and Validation
A simulation is useless if you can't trust it. I learned that "coding the model" is only half the work.
* **Verification:** I executed preliminary simulation runs to ensure our code behavior matched theoretical baselines (e.g., ensuring agents actually converged when noise was zero).
* **Metric Selection:** We moved beyond simple observation to rigorous statistical analysis, using metrics like the **Polarization Index**, **Opinion Modularity**, and **Hartigan’s Dip Test** to quantify our results.

## 5. Continuous vs. Discrete Dynamics
From a data analysis perspective, I learned why **continuous representations** (float values between 0.0 and 1.0) are often superior to discrete categories for simulation. Continuous data allows for more granular statistical tools (like variance and distribution shape analysis), capturing subtle shifts in opinion that binary models miss.

**Tech Stack Used:** Python, NetworkX, NumPy, Matplotlib, LaTeX.

**Final Thought:**
CSE 6730 taught me that simulation isn't just about predicting the future; it's about understanding the *mechanisms* of the present. By adjusting a single parameter—like the tolerance of extremist agents—we can see how fragile social consensus really is.
