### Context

For my final project in **CSE 6242 (Data and Visual Analytics)**, our team built **Scholar Compass**, a tool to help students find academic advisors. instead of just listing papers, we combined interactive visualizations with AI-generated narratives.

### 1\. Why Neo4j? (The Power of Graphs)

We chose **Neo4j** over traditional relational databases (SQL) or document stores (MongoDB) for the data layer.

  * **The Problem:** Academic data is highly interconnected (Authors co-author Papers; Papers cite Papers; Authors belong to Institutions).
  * **The Solution:** Neo4j models these explicitly as nodes and relationships.
  * **The Benefit:** Finding collaboration networks became trivial. Instead of complex `JOIN` operations, we could use simple Cypher queries to traverse the graph:
    ```cypher
    // Example: Finding an advisor's top collaborators
    MATCH (a:Author {name: "Target Professor"})-[:AUTHORED]->(p:Paper)<-[:AUTHORED]-(collab:Author)
    RETURN collab.name, count(p) as strength
    ORDER BY strength DESC
    ```
    This made generating the **Collaboration Network** visualization significantly faster and more intuitive.

### 2\. The RAG Pipeline (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

We didn't want a generic LLM chat; we wanted the AI to interpret our specific data. We implemented a **RAG** architecture using **Flask**:

  * **Workflow:**
    1.  **Frontend:** User queries a professor's name.
    2.  **Retrieval:** Flask executes Cypher queries against Neo4j to fetch structured data (publication stats, top venues, topic shifts).
    3.  **Augmentation:** This structured data is injected into a system prompt as "Ground Truth."
    4.  **Generation:** An LLM (Qwen-Flash) generates a natural language summary that explains the four dashboard visualizations (Network, Streamgraph, etc.).
  * **Key Takeaway:** By grounding the LLM in the Neo4j data, we eliminated hallucinations. The AI became an "analyst" effectively reading the charts for the user.

### 3\. System Architecture

  * **Frontend:** HTML/JS/D3.js (for rendering force-directed graphs and streamgraphs).
  * **Backend:** Python Flask (acts as the API gateway).
  * **Database:** Neo4j (Dockerized).
  * **AI:** RAG via LLM API.

### Conclusion

Combining **Graph Databases** with **LLMs** is a powerful pattern. The graph provides the structural context (relationships) that LLMs usually lack, and the LLM provides the narrative layer that raw graph data lacks. This project bridged the gap between quantitative metrics and qualitative insights.
